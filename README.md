# DevNet / Network Programmability Studies Playground

## Introduction

This project is a playgroud for exploring Cisco DevNet and network programmability.
The repo has no intention to create production level code, but is simply a place for
me to store some experiment along the way.

I intend to place code from multiple tutorials here from resources such as:
 * teamtreehouse.com
 * cbtnuggets.com
 * ine.com

And any other books, resources or tutorials along the way.

While it is mainly focused on DevNet and network programmability, some web dev stuff
may sneak in, particularly where this overlaps with the main goal (Hoping to create
a web page / app with a REST API using Flask or Django at some point).
