XML, JSON, YAML

XML:
    Elements -> everything between and including an opening and closing tag
    Attributes
    Self-Closing Tag
    &apos;   <---'
    &quot;   <---"
    DOM - Document Object Model -> just think of HTML :)
    Used by Netconf

    Prolog:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    
    The Rest:

        <Mainbody itsAnAttribute="True">
            <Stuff>MyStuff</Stuff>
            <ICloseMyself Name="kitty"/>
        </Mainbody>

JSON:
    You know this from JS! Easy Peasy :)
    Double quotes required for keys
    strings, booleans ( true | false <--LOWERCASE), ints (not in quotes), objects and arrays good for values
    import json
        json.loads()
        json.load()

YAML:
    Designed to be human legible
    White space matters!
    Key-value pairs (scaler values for values)
    Collections start with: -
    Starts with: ---
    Ends with: ...
    # for comments
    strings with or without quotes; quotes needed for escape characters
    booleans (titlecase, uppercase, lowercase exceptable)
